I'm a {{ 'now' | date: '%Y' | minus: 1990 }}-year-old software engineer based in Hyderabad, India. For the past **6+ years** I've been coding mostly in *PHP*, *Python* and *JavaScript*. I love writing code, listening to music and playing games on the computer.

I love gaming of all sorts, computers and programming languages.

All opinions are my own.
