I'm a {{ 'now' | date: '%Y' | minus: 1990 }}-year-old software engineer based in Hyderabad, India. For the past **{{ 'now' | date: '%Y' | minus: 2011 }}+ years** I've been coding mostly in *PHP*, *Python* and *JavaScript* with a strong interest in algorithms, data structures, and back-end development. I love writing code, listening to music and playing games on the computer.
