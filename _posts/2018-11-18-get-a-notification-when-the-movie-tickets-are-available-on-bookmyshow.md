This python script checks if movie tickets are available for a showtime and send an email notification. I have written this in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} using [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/){:target="_blank"}.

Run the script using `python3 app.py`.
