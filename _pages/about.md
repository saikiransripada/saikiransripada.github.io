<div class="pretty-links">

<div class="lead lead-about">For the past **6+ years** I've been coding mostly in *PHP*, *Python* and *JavaScript*.
</div>

I'm a {{ 'now' | date: '%Y' | minus: 1990 }}-year-old software engineer based in Hyderabad, India. I love writing code, listening to music and playing games on the computer.

When I'm not sleeping, you'll find me [*listening to music*](https://last.fm/user/thephpguy){:target="_blank"} or [*playing games*](https://steamcommunity.com/id/cybercriminal){:target="_blank"} or [*coding an interesting project*](/projects){:rel="nofollow"}.

I love gaming of all sorts, computers and programming languages.

This blog is a timeline of my life. I blog to document my ideas, research and personal feelings for future reference.
