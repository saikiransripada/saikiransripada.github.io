<div class="pretty-links">

<div class="lead lead-about">For the past **6+ years** I've been coding mostly in *PHP* and *JavaScript*.
</div>

I'm a {{ 'now' | date: '%Y' | minus: 1990 }}-year-old software engineer based in Hyderabad, India. I love writing code, listening to music and playing games on the computer.

When I'm not sleeping, you'll find me <a href="https://last.fm/user/thephpguy" target="_blank">*listening to music*</a> or <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/cybercriminal" target="_blank">*playing games*</a> or <a href="/projects">*coding an interesting project*</a>.

I love gaming of all sorts, computers and programming languages.

This blog is a timeline of my life. I blog to document my ideas, research and personal feelings for future reference.
