Hi, I'm Kiran, a {{ 'now' | date: '%Y' | minus: 1990 }} year old software engineer based in Hyderabad, India. I love writing code, listening to music and playing games on the computer.

When I'm not sleeping, you can find me <a href="https://last.fm/user/thephpguy" target="_blank">listening to music</a> or <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/cybercriminal" target="_blank">playing games</a> or <a href="/projects">coding an interesting project</a>.

This blog is a timeline of my life. I blog to document my ideas, research and personal feelings for future reference.
